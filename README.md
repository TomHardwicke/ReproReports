### Overview
This is a simple R package that contains an Rmarkdown template and a couple of custom functions for building reports for reproducibility class assignments.

### Installation
To install the template, you will first need to install a package called devtools:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then run the following command to install the template directy from this Github page:

```r
devtools::install_github("TomHardwicke/reproducibility_assignment/ReproReports")
```

Next time you create a new R markdown document, select 'from template', then choose "CARP Report".
